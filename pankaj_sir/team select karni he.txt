Hey Nakul! This is actually a very solid foundation for a console-based Fantasy Cricket (Dream11-style) application. You've covered a lot of important parts. Let me break it down for you with a quick review:

✅ What’s Good:
Clear Structure & Service Layer Use:

Separation between model, service, and main logic is a big plus.

Using Service classes makes the code modular and maintainable.

Admin & User Functionality:

You’ve implemented both admin and user login/signup, which is essential in such apps.

Admin tasks like adding/deleting players/contests are well handled.

Basic Contest & Player Management:

Storing players and contests in a database and displaying them dynamically is great.

You've even added prize pool breakdown, which shows you're thinking ahead.

Interactive Console UI:

Simple but effective user prompts make it easy to test and navigate.

Good use of ResultSet:

You're fetching and using data properly from the database.

❌ What Could Be Improved or Added:
1. Validation & Error Handling:
Add more input validation (like not allowing negative money or duplicate IDs).

Handle SQLException or any DB error more gracefully with try-catch blocks.

2. Code Repetition:
You’re creating a new Scanner object in every method. It’s better to create it once and pass it around or make it static final.

java
Copy
Edit
private static final Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
3. User Team Creation Logic Missing:
The createTeam() method just shows players. You should allow users to select players, check credit limits, save their team, etc.

This is a core part of Fantasy apps — the most fun part for users.

4. Wallet Deduction on Joining Contest:
You're showing wallet balance but not deducting the contest entry fee when a user joins — that should be added.

5. Contest Join Logic:
Need to store which user joined which contest, and ensure max participants aren’t exceeded.

6. Result Calculation (Optional but Cool):
Let users earn points based on player performance (you can randomly assign or simulate scores for now).

💡 Suggestions for Extra Coolness:
Add a leaderboard.

Simulate a match and update wallet balance based on winnings.

Make a proper team object where user selects 11 players and stores it.

Assign fixed credit to each player and enforce the total team credit rule (like max 100).

Add logging for debugging.

📊 Overall Rating: 8/10 🌟
This is a really good college project and shows you understand object-oriented design and real-world systems. With a few enhancements — especially around team creation, wallet handling, and contest logic — you’ll take it from good to great.
