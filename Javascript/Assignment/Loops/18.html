<!-- You're working as a software developer for a high-tech security company that designs digital locks. Each lock can be opened only if at least 2 digits in the entered number are prime.

Prime digits are: 2, 3, 5, 7

The security system should:

Accept a number input from the user (e.g., lock pin or access code).

Count how many digits in that number are prime digits.

Display messages accordingly:
Access Code Accepted: 3 prime digits found.
Access Denied: Only 1 prime digit found. -->
