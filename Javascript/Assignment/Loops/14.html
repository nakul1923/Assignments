You are developing a system for a classroom where each student is assigned a unique ID number. The teacher needs to find out how many unique divisors are associated with each student ID to verify the validity of the IDs based on specific criteria. The system should count and return the number of unique divisors for each ID provided.
Input format :
The input consists of an integer n.
Output format :
The output prints the count of the factors of the number.
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
25
Output 1 :
3
Input 2 :
