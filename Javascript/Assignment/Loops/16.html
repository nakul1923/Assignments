<!-- You're programming a new LED display game. The game level unlocks when a neon number is entered.

A neon number is a number where the sum of the digits of its square is equal to the number itself. Example: 9 → 9² = 81 → 8 + 1 = 9

Your task:

Accept a number from the player.

Check if it's a neon number.

Display:

 "Glowing Success! You've found the Neon Number!"

 "Try again! Not quite glowing yet." -->
