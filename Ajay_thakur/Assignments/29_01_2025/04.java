/*
 * 1. Bank Account Management
Objective: Create a program to manage bank accounts and handle exceptions for insufficient balance and negative deposit amounts.

Details:
Create a BankAccount class with fields for accountNumber, accountHolder, and balance.
Define two custom exceptions:
InsufficientBalanceException for withdrawal amounts exceeding the balance.
NegativeDepositException for deposits with negative amounts.
Include methods for deposit(double amount) and withdraw(double amount) that throw the respective exceptions.
In the main method, demonstrate various cases like successful transactions, insufficient balance, and invalidÂ deposits.
