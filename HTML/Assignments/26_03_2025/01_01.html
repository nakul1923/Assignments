    <p>The chats by The Atlantic, which first published the story about the massive security breach on Monday, were released after Mr Hegseth, while responding to a reporter on why he shared plans about a forthcoming attack on Yemen, said that "Nobody was texting war plans".

        "The statements by Hegseth, (national intelligence director Tulsi) Gabbard, (CIA director John) Ratcliffe, and Trump - combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts - have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions," the magazine said.
        
        Decoding Trump's Leaked Yemen War Plan
        In the screenshots shared by The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg can be seen being added to the "Houthi PC small group" on March 11 by Michael Waltz.
        
        Mr Waltz also changed the settings so the group messages will automatically disappear after one week. Later, the NSA extended the timer to four weeks.
        
        "Team - establishing a principles group for coordination on Houthis, particularly over the next 72 hours," Mr Waltz apparently said at 4:28 pm on March 13.
        
        The "principles group" referred to the Principals Committee, which is convened by the National Security Advisor and generally includes the heads of departments or agencies involved with the subject matter being discussed at a given meeting.
        
        "Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx," Mr Waltz added.</p>
